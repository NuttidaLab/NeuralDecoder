# 📝Notebooks

This folder contains Jupyter notebooks for experimentation and study purposes. It helps to keep the project organized by separating experimental work from other important components. Users can refer to the notebooks to gain insights into the project's development and see how ideas were tested and refined. However, caution should be exercised as the notebooks may contain errors or unfinished work. The folder serves as a valuable resource for anyone interested in the project's development and thought process.
